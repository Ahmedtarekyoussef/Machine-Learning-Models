# Machine-Learning-Models
This repository contains multiple machine learning models made with pandas (python), each one of which is described in detail in the README file.

"PredictCarPrice.ipynb" is a dataset that contains information about cars and their prices. The first step we took was to explore the data and examine its data types, as well as perform statistical analysis on its numeric data types. Next, we began the data cleaning process, taking several actions such as converting object data types to integers (e.g. odometer) and correcting erroneous data (e.g. the 'Doors' column). We found 1663 records with cars priced below $500, which does not make sense, so we imputed these prices by using linear regression techniques. We used labeled and one-hot encoding to convert categorical data into numerical data for modeling. We created three models: the first was a simple decision tree, which had an MAE value of 5777.0; the second was a decision tree with a predetermined best depth that we found by using a specific trial and error technique (the best tree size was discovered to be 35), and it showed an MAE value of 8120.0; and the third and final model was a Random Forest model, which had an MAE value of 6693.0.
